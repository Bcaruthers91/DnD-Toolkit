# DnD-Toolkit
A simple collection of tools to play Dungeons and Dragons 5e created as a student project by Ben Caruthers in 2019.
Includes Dice Rolling, an Initiative Tracker, and a few tabs of quick references for rules and keywords.

Update: There is now a link to a searchable spell list. 
I did not make this spell compendium but instead wanted to add a restricted web browser feature. The sorting functions do not work but you can sort or specify searches by finding and clicking their respective links (eg. clicking Paladin brings up paladin spell list)
